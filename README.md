A WordPress plugin that synchronizes products from an OpenCart store into WooCommerce as **variable products**, complete with categories, brands, attributes, and variations.

## Description

OC2WP Sync connects directly to your OpenCart database and:

1. Imports product base data (model, price, images)
2. Maps categories and creates them in WooCommerce
3. Registers a global `pa_brand` attribute and assigns manufacturers
4. Reads all product options from OpenCart and turns them into WooCommerce attributes
5. Generates every combination of option values as individual WooCommerce variations
6. Splits the import into configurable chunks to avoid timeouts

A built-in Settings page lets you configure your OpenCart DB connection without touching any code. A single-page Sync UI shows real-time logs as products and variations are imported.
